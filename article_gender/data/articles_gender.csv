"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p>A dog owner who stabbed a stranger twice in an unprovoked attack has been jailed for seven and a half years.</p><p>David Hall, 39, attacked Dean Anderson near a canal path in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, in April, when Mr Anderson helped two women who were being threatened by Hall after his Staffordshire bull terrier began snarling at their pet.</p><p>He disarmed Hall of a hammer, but Hall produced a knife and stabbed him in the chest and back.

"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p class=""dropcap@1"">When the president of the United States, the American business establishment and a chorus of stock market analysts and media commentators agree on something, it may be time for investors to check that their wallets are safely under lock and key.</p><p>Donald Trump said last week that the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator of the world’s most important financial markets, should consider ending the rule that companies listed on US stock exchanges must report their earnings every three months, and instead move to six-monthly reporting. “That would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money. I have asked the SEC to study!”, the president tweeted.</p><p>His brainwave was apparently inspired by a dinner he hosted for some chief executives of US companies this year. Indra Nooyi, the outgoing boss of PepsiCo, said she raised the issue of moving from quarterly to half-yearly reporting when Mr Trump asked his guests what the government could do to help US businesses.</p><p>Quarterly reporting, it is argued, is one of the chief causes of short-termism by companies, at the expense of long-term investment, research and development, and economic growth. The practice consumes a disproportionate amount of the time of chief executives and chief financial officers. And it is a stock market obsession, driving share price movements, market volatility and the sort of market cheerleading seen on CNBC.</p><p class=""dropcap"">There is merit to these arguments. Too many bosses are fixated on the share price. Providing a window into a company’s operational and financial performance every three months hardly gives a rounded picture of what is actually going on. Anybody who has listened to quarterly earnings conference calls will know that, while many of them provide vast quantities of information, few offer real knowledge about complex trading, financial, R&amp;D and other key performance measures.</p><p>Some sectoral analysts are of the “Hey guys! Great quarter! I have three questions . . .” variety. Many of them place excessive emphasis on short-term financial performance at the expense of other indicators. So when, say, pharmaceutical companies report earnings, the bulk of the calls is taken up by questions about the past three months rather than the next three years. Still, analysts are just doing what they are paid to do.</p><p>Yet there are problems with any move to end quarterly earnings reporting. First, it would reduce the flow of information to investors. That cannot be a sound basis on which to build stock market value, especially in a situation such as we are in now, where a decade-long bull market has been created on the basis of cheap money and central-bank intervention as much as on corporate fundamentals.

Manafort faces a maximum jail sentence of 80 years and the prospect of a second trial on further charges in Washington next month.</p><p>While strongly supported by grassroots Democrats, with polls showing three to one in favour, an impeachment to force the president out of office requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate — a distant prospect even if Republicans lose overall control.</p><p>It is clear that Mr Trump is prepared to make the midterm elections, which historically have a lower turnout than the presidential election, a referendum on his presidency. His team has said he intends to be the most active president in recent history to hit the campaign trail as voters choose the whole House of Representatives, a third of the Senate and 36 of 50 state governors.</p><p>The caution shown by Democrats in making impeachment a big campaign issue was endorsed by Nancy Pelosi, 78, minority leader of the House. “Impeachment has to spring from something else,” she said, adding that Democrats should focus on legislative responsibilities and ensuring that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, finished his inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling. “If and when information emerges about that, we’ll see,” she said.</p><media type=""image"" template=""primary"" id=""b09f5236-75a6-4ba8-8cd0-37405cf074f8""/><p>There was no such reluctance to make the elections about impeachment from Tom Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager and Democrat activist, who said yesterday that he had commissioned TV advertising for his Need To Impeach campaign.</p><p>Al Green, a Texas congressman who has also called for impeachment, tweeted: “The framers of the constitution provided impeachment as the way to remove an unfit president. The ultimate question is, does Congress have the will?”</p><p>Senior Republicans mostly took cover yesterday. One of the few to speak out was Orrin Hatch, the senator for Utah who has supported Mr Trump and is retiring in November. He said of Cohen’s accusations: “Those are serious charges and they can’t be ignored.”</p><p>Mitt Romney, who ran against Barack Obama in 2012 and is standing for Mr Hatch’s seat in November, tweeted: “The events of the last 24 hours confirm that conduct by highly placed individuals was dishonourable and illegal.

"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p>A stand-up comedian told jokes and sang opera while her doctors removed a brain tumour during a nine-hour operation. Sarah-May Philo, 34, from Glasgow, had to be awake so her brain function could be measured. She told <i>The Scottish Sun</i>: “I thought trying to make people laugh would make everyone more relaxed . . . It really broke the ice.”</p><p><b>Ambulance overturns</b><br/>An ambulance responding to an emergency call overturned after a collision with another vehicle. None of the ambulance crew or the driver of the other vehicle, a Ford Ranger, was injured. The accident happened at about 6.40am yesterday at Whitburn Cross, West Lothian, when the ambulance was on its way to a call-out in Bathgate. The Scottish Ambulance Service said: “Another ambulance was quickly dispatched to deal with the original call in Bathgate.”</p><p><b>US flight is moved from Glasgow to Edinburgh </b><br/>American Airlines is scrapping a route between Glasgow and Philadelphia next month and re-launching the service from Edinburgh airport in April. It will also be stopping flights from Edinburgh to JFK in New York. Gordon Dewar, the chief executive of Edinburgh airport, said: “We’re delighted to add Philadelphia to our options and offer yet another new destination in North America to our passengers.” A spokesman for Glasgow airport said that the decision was disappointing but added that there were still a number of services that connected it with North America.</p><p><b>Three Orkney islands for sale, seals not included</b><br/>Three Scottish islands have been put on the market in the same sale. The uninhabited Orkney islands of Faray, Holm of Faray and Red Holm are situated between the islands of Westray and Eday and offers of more than £200,000 are invited. The first two have been declared sites of special scientific interest and special areas of conservation because of their resident grey seals. They are tenanted until November next year, with the tenant stocking them with sheep. Lows, the selling agent, said that interested parties can travel to the islands via a private boat, which will carry them from Westray for £100.</p><p><b>Prisoners taken to court in their underwear</b><br/>Police have been criticised for taking prisoners to court in their pyjamas or underwear. At Edinburgh sheriff court HM Inspectorate of Prisons for Scotland saw prisoners being taken from escort vans in shorts and one had no shoes. Inspectors said this was unacceptable. “Police Scotland should ensure that those arriving from police custody are appropriately dressed,” it said. Inspectors also said clarification was needed over the provision of medical information to ensure that staff could manage prisoners safely. A spokesman said the force was keen to work on the recommendations.</p><p><b>Man, 71, lives after heart stopped for half an hour</b><br/>Stephen Nardone, 71, survived after his heart stopped for 27 minutes at a primary school nativity play. There were four off-duty nurses in the audience at St Kenneth’s RC Primary School in Ballingry, Fife, last December who performed CPR until an ambulance arrived after he suffered a cardiac arrest. Mr Nardone, a retired financial worker, of Crosshill, Fife, spent four days in an induced coma at Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy. He has returned to the school to thank the nurses and paramedics who saved his life and is raising money for a school defibrillator.</p><p><b>Failings in patient care</b><br/>There were “significant and serious failings” in the care of a patient who died from a cardiac arrest three weeks after a hip replacement operation.

"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p class=""dropcap@1"">What a strange man Rory Stewart is. Last week the prisons minister did something truly weird. He promised to resign if he hadn’t done his job properly. Setting himself a deadline of 12 months in which to reduce levels of drug use and violence in ten struggling prisons, Stewart said: “I believe that this can be turned around and I want you to judge me on those results and I will resign if I don’t succeed.”</p><p>It says so much about our political culture that this seems at all remarkable. Most normal people know that the price for not doing their job tends to be losing it, yet Stewart clearly felt it was necessary to state what should be the bleeding obvious: if he doesn’t do what he is supposed to, then he’ll go.</p><p>Cynics might wonder whether the minister secretly expects not to have to meet his deadline at all: chances are he’ll be reshuffled into another role or Britain will end up with yet another election before then. Or there are ways of giving the appearance of progress without actually changing things for the long term: if you divert funding and attention towards your pet projects, you might see some newsworthy changes. In the case of prisons, that would come at the cost of the wider system, which, as we saw this week when the Ministry of Justice took HMP Birmingham back under government control, is hardly in great shape.</p><p>In fact, one of the underlying problems with the prison system is that so few ministers have taken any responsibility for it at all. The turnover in the department overseeing these institutions is staggering: if you move to the Ministry of Justice, you generally only serve a short sentence before being transferred elsewhere. In the eight years that the Conservatives have been in government, they have had six justice secretaries. Not one of the MPs who are ministers in the department today was there a year ago.</p><p>Stewart and his colleagues are really only just finding their feet. They certainly won’t have had time to work out which of their predecessors was responsible for the various messes they are now charged with clearing up.</p><p>It’s easy to avoid taking responsibility in Westminster. So many policies take years to bear any fruit — or for their true idiocy to be revealed — and therefore the minister who came up with the bright idea in the first place has a pretty strong chance of having left not just government but also parliament before they have to answer for their decisions.</p><p>The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, for instance, halved the number of young women becoming pregnant, which should have been cause for a fiesta of press releases taking credit. But the policy took 15 years to reach that target, by which time all its New Labour architects had moved out of government and into new lives. It must still be satisfying for those involved to look back on a success. But equally, it must be even more of a relief to those ex-ministers who can turn their backs on something stupid that they cooked up long ago.</p><p>The short-term nature of politics means that you’re far more likely to get into trouble for the political implications of your work than for the impact they have on ordinary people. If a policy doesn’t cause a row in parliament in the weeks and months after it has been announced then it can appear a success. But this is a recipe for bad policy-making: it’s why politicians are so keen to avoid taking controversial decisions on mass housebuilding, airport capacity and social care reform.</p><p>Which minister who failed over the past two decades to get to grips with a chronic problem such as the underfunding of social care has had to take any responsibility for the consequences, save perhaps seeing an elderly relative screwed over by the current shambolic system? No one gets recalled to parliament or select committees to answer for why they didn’t do something, or indeed for why they made a catastrophic decision many years ago. Once you’re out of your ministerial job, you’re safe from blame.</p><p>Humble backbenchers are guilty too. I have spent the past three years shadowing politicians for my forthcoming book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, and was shocked by how many problems in their constituency surgeries related to policies those MPs approved in parliament. MPs often vote on legislation without knowing what it entails, sometimes because they have chosen not to find out.</p><p>Liz Truss, for instance, worked hard on the bill committee scrutinising the cuts to legal aid in 2011, and before long was climbing the ministerial career ladder, including a stint as justice secretary. But her definition of “hard work” largely involved trying to trip up witnesses who were claiming that the bill as drafted would undermine access to justice.

So many policies take years to bear any fruit — or for their true idiocy to be revealed — and therefore the minister who came up with the bright idea in the first place has a pretty strong chance of having left not just government but also parliament before they have to answer for their decisions.</p><p>The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, for instance, halved the number of young women becoming pregnant, which should have been cause for a fiesta of press releases taking credit. But the policy took 15 years to reach that target, by which time all its New Labour architects had moved out of government and into new lives. It must still be satisfying for those involved to look back on a success. But equally, it must be even more of a relief to those ex-ministers who can turn their backs on something stupid that they cooked up long ago.</p><p>The short-term nature of politics means that you’re far more likely to get into trouble for the political implications of your work than for the impact they have on ordinary people. If a policy doesn’t cause a row in parliament in the weeks and months after it has been announced then it can appear a success.

So many policies take years to bear any fruit — or for their true idiocy to be revealed — and therefore the minister who came up with the bright idea in the first place has a pretty strong chance of having left not just government but also parliament before they have to answer for their decisions.</p><p>The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, for instance, halved the number of young women becoming pregnant, which should have been cause for a fiesta of press releases taking credit. But the policy took 15 years to reach that target, by which time all its New Labour architects had moved out of government and into new lives. It must still be satisfying for those involved to look back on a success. But equally, it must be even more of a relief to those ex-ministers who can turn their backs on something stupid that they cooked up long ago.</p><p>The short-term nature of politics means that you’re far more likely to get into trouble for the political implications of your work than for the impact they have on ordinary people. If a policy doesn’t cause a row in parliament in the weeks and months after it has been announced then it can appear a success. But this is a recipe for bad policy-making: it’s why politicians are so keen to avoid taking controversial decisions on mass housebuilding, airport capacity and social care reform.</p><p>Which minister who failed over the past two decades to get to grips with a chronic problem such as the underfunding of social care has had to take any responsibility for the consequences, save perhaps seeing an elderly relative screwed over by the current shambolic system?

"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p class=""dropcap@1"">Paper and packaging may lack the kerb appeal of big, bright technology companies and the heavyweight miners, but in this era of ever increasing shopping online it is a sector whose star is on the rise. Analysts at Jefferies unwrapped their latest view of its prospects yesterday and investors liked what they saw.</p><p><b>Mondi </b>topped the bill. The broker’s experts reiterated their “buy” recommendation on the stock and raised their price target from £24.50 to £25. Shares in the FTSE 100 global packaging supplier promptly rose 30p to £21.48.</p><p>The broker cited Mondi’s low-cost pulp and paper business model as an advantage, delivering the highest margins and return on capital in the sector. Mondi runs about 100 production sites in more than 30 countries, many of which are in emerging market areas with access to trees that provide low-cost fibre. “Mondi . . . is the quality play in the sector, delivering value-accretive growth,” Jefferies said. And there was more: consolidation in Europe, which lags the United States in terms of market dominance of the five top players, was forecast to continue, creating opportunities for UK-listed paper and packaging companies to add scale.</p><p>Smurfit Kappa, the Irish packaging group, also received a “buy” recommendation as Jefferies forecast that it would boost earnings this year, citing higher box prices and volumes and benefits from its €460 million acquisition of Reparenco, a paper and packaging business in the Netherlands. The broker kept a “hold” recommendation for <b>DS Smith</b>, the FTSE 100 cardboard box maker, saying that estimates had not yet factored in its proposed £1.7 billion acquisition of Europac, a Spanish rival. Smurfit Kappa fell slightly, by 6p to £32.24, but DS Smith added 7½p to 504¼p.</p><p>The FTSE 100 edged 8.54 points up to 7,574.24 as traders reported low volumes, with many fund managers on holiday. The broader FTSE 250 fell by a mere 0.36 points to 20,642.50.</p><p><b>John Wood Group</b>, the British oilfield services provider, led the mid-cap gainers for a second day as its positive interim results continued to impress. Barclays raised its target price to 750p from 690p, saying that reduced “noise” from the workers’ union and a rebound in revenues had helped to “present a credible growth and margin recovery story to investors” after the company’s merger with Amec Foster Wheeler last October. The shares rose 46½p to 758½p.</p><p>Continued speculation about a new takeover bid for <b>Spire Healthcare</b> from <b>Mediclinic</b> helped to boost both. Spire rose 3¾p to 170p; Mediclinic climbed 16p to 491p.</p><p><b>John Menzies</b>, the Scottish aviation company, fell 7p to 587p after a shareholder rebellion over executive pay at its annual meeting. Executives and senior bosses have been lined up to receive up to £30 million of shares if they hit performance targets once the group’s distribution division is sold.

"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p class=""dropcap@1"">Just before Christmas 2015, Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen took to Twitter to address his client’s likely opponent Hillary Clinton directly. “When you go to prison for defrauding America and perjury,” he told her, “your room and board will be free!”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Hillary of course has never been charged with anything and as of Tuesday Michael Cohen is looking at going to prison after pleading guilty to bank fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance fraud. This last crime was, he says, carried out at the direct behest of Mr Trump. Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis said yesterday that his client had “decided on July 2nd to press the reset button” and there would now be established a Michael Cohen Truth Fund.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Reset buttons are a good idea. We should press ours. So let’s imagine that 20 odd years ago Rippa Van Winkle, an upright, fair-minded, un-ideological American citizen, fell asleep and only woke up a year ago. After marvelling at the development of the internet and the fact that no one uses phones as phones any more, she begins to look at who is ruling America. She is interested only in facts. What would someone like that make of Donald Trump being her president?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">She would almost certainly note that, for whatever reason, he is a constant and unashamed liar. The record shows also that he is a serial adulterer who has boasted on tape about sexually harassing women. If she dips into the more reliable biographies of him she will discover that he seems to be a bit of a racist. Rippa will have seen his propensity for harshly criticising America’s oldest allies and warmly commending various authoritarian leaders abroad. She’ll have watched the unprecedented merry-go-round of incoming and sacked cabinet members.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">And in the last few months there have been all those close associates in trouble with the law. Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador; Rick Gates to conspiracy and lying to the FBI; and on Tuesday the former campaign manager and Trump hearty Paul Manafort, found guilty on eight counts of tax and bank fraud and of hiding a foreign bank account — and most of it in the service of some ultra-dodgy oligarch-types.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa takes account of the suggestion that, never mind the quality, feel the width. Hasn’t Mr Trump presided over an unprecedented economic recovery, and have his unorthodox foreign policies not yielded unexpected dividends? She looks at the figures and the results, compares them with past presidents and concludes, coolly, that there is no real evidence for either claim. She may even recall that when she first went to sleep Republicans were in favour of free trade and against deficits and now they appear to prefer trade wars and unfunded tax cuts.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On Tuesday Rippa watched, as we did, when Lanny Davis hinted at more Cohen truth-telling to come. And this time on a matter which touches on the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election (which she fortunately missed) and possible collusion with the Russians by the Trump campaign.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">“Rippa,” we ask her, “none of us can be sure of this at the moment. But if you had to guess whether Donald Trump knew that the Russians were offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016, what would you say?” And Rippa, beyond a flicker of a doubt would say, “Of course he did, are you kidding me? This is Donald Trump we’re talking about.”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">When in June 2016, after an exchange of emails, Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, in the expectation that she had from somewhere procured “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, it is a stretch to believe that Trump Senior did not know. And Rippa wonders whether even if Veselnitskaya had had “FSB” tattooed on her knuckles, the Trumps would have seen anything wrong in mining her for useful stuff.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa is tired now, and we’ll let her go. We’ve told her that Trump can’t be criminally indicted for the campaign finance fraud, because he’s the president. He could possibly be impeached for it, because impeachment is in the first instance a political act. The House of Representatives has to vote for impeachment by a simple majority, but for it to be successful the Senate then has to try the case and find against the incumbent by a two thirds majority. Nixon wasn’t impeached: he resigned before he could be. With Bill Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky affair the Republican House voted 221 to 212 that he should be, but the majority wasn’t there in the Senate. His poll ratings climbed.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On November 6, midterm elections for the House and Senate could lead to a Democrat majority in the first and almost a tie in the second. In that case the Democrats might feel emboldened to begin impeachment proceedings. Many will want them to, but should they?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">If the Michael Cohen Truth Fund or anyone else can provide proof that Donald Trump knew and approved of Russian government attempts to sabotage the Clinton campaign, then Congress — Democrat or Republican — has no choice, morally or constitutionally but to impeach. But in the absence of that proof, and despite the seriousness of Cohen’s allegations against the president concerning hush payments to women during the election campaign, the Democrats should think better of it.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s not just because if they do get rid of Trump they effectively elect the culture warrior Mike Pence. It’s because for the period of the proceedings they will inevitably be substituting process for politics. Should Trump survive the attempt he might, like a malign Obi Wan Kenobi — and Bill Clinton — emerge even stronger, and the Democrats will have wasted several critical months when they should have been arguing about how America could be better.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s true that anti-Trump feeling energises the Democrat base, and quite a few other people as well. But a successful 2020 presidential bid, which after all begins pretty soon, requires so much more. The Democrats have to be the party of growth, fair taxes, decent health provision, infrastructural improvement, of the working person as well as of the entrepreneur. They have to tackle gerrymandering, bent campaign finance and the antiquated and vulnerable US electoral system. And in Bill Clinton’s words, they must never stop arguing. But as Americans might put it, impeachment is an O2-suck. It detracts from the task.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Over here we can only look on. The United States is indispensable for us, but alas we matter only a bit to a Bostonian, a little less to a San Diegan and not at all to a Utahn. And since we’re not Russians we have no say in US elections. We have seen America at its best and can only hope that the best returns.</p></div>",true

His poll ratings climbed.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On November 6, midterm elections for the House and Senate could lead to a Democrat majority in the first and almost a tie in the second.

Many will want them to, but should they?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">If the Michael Cohen Truth Fund or anyone else can provide proof that Donald Trump knew and approved of Russian government attempts to sabotage the Clinton campaign, then Congress — Democrat or Republican — has no choice, morally or constitutionally but to impeach. But in the absence of that proof, and despite the seriousness of Cohen’s allegations against the president concerning hush payments to women during the election campaign, the Democrats should think better of it.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s not just because if they do get rid of Trump they effectively elect the culture warrior Mike Pence. It’s because for the period of the proceedings they will inevitably be substituting process for politics. Should Trump survive the attempt he might, like a malign Obi Wan Kenobi — and Bill Clinton — emerge even stronger, and the Democrats will have wasted several critical months when they should have been arguing about how America could be better.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s true that anti-Trump feeling energises the Democrat base, and quite a few other people as well. But a successful 2020 presidential bid, which after all begins pretty soon, requires so much more. The Democrats have to be the party of growth, fair taxes, decent health provision, infrastructural improvement, of the working person as well as of the entrepreneur. They have to tackle gerrymandering, bent campaign finance and the antiquated and vulnerable US electoral system. And in Bill Clinton’s words, they must never stop arguing.

We should press ours. So let’s imagine that 20 odd years ago Rippa Van Winkle, an upright, fair-minded, un-ideological American citizen, fell asleep and only woke up a year ago. After marvelling at the development of the internet and the fact that no one uses phones as phones any more, she begins to look at who is ruling America. She is interested only in facts. What would someone like that make of Donald Trump being her president?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">She would almost certainly note that, for whatever reason, he is a constant and unashamed liar. The record shows also that he is a serial adulterer who has boasted on tape about sexually harassing women. If she dips into the more reliable biographies of him she will discover that he seems to be a bit of a racist. Rippa will have seen his propensity for harshly criticising America’s oldest allies and warmly commending various authoritarian leaders abroad. She’ll have watched the unprecedented merry-go-round of incoming and sacked cabinet members.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">And in the last few months there have been all those close associates in trouble with the law. Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador; Rick Gates to conspiracy and lying to the FBI; and on Tuesday the former campaign manager and Trump hearty Paul Manafort, found guilty on eight counts of tax and bank fraud and of hiding a foreign bank account — and most of it in the service of some ultra-dodgy oligarch-types.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa takes account of the suggestion that, never mind the quality, feel the width. Hasn’t Mr Trump presided over an unprecedented economic recovery, and have his unorthodox foreign policies not yielded unexpected dividends? She looks at the figures and the results, compares them with past presidents and concludes, coolly, that there is no real evidence for either claim. She may even recall that when she first went to sleep Republicans were in favour of free trade and against deficits and now they appear to prefer trade wars and unfunded tax cuts.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On Tuesday Rippa watched, as we did, when Lanny Davis hinted at more Cohen truth-telling to come. And this time on a matter which touches on the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election (which she fortunately missed) and possible collusion with the Russians by the Trump campaign.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">“Rippa,” we ask her, “none of us can be sure of this at the moment. But if you had to guess whether Donald Trump knew that the Russians were offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016, what would you say?” And Rippa, beyond a flicker of a doubt would say, “Of course he did, are you kidding me? This is Donald Trump we’re talking about.”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">When in June 2016, after an exchange of emails, Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, in the expectation that she had from somewhere procured “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, it is a stretch to believe that Trump Senior did not know. And Rippa wonders whether even if Veselnitskaya had had “FSB” tattooed on her knuckles, the Trumps would have seen anything wrong in mining her for useful stuff.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa is tired now, and we’ll let her go. We’ve told her that Trump can’t be criminally indicted for the campaign finance fraud, because he’s the president. He could possibly be impeached for it, because impeachment is in the first instance a political act. The House of Representatives has to vote for impeachment by a simple majority, but for it to be successful the Senate then has to try the case and find against the incumbent by a two thirds majority. Nixon wasn’t impeached: he resigned before he could be. With Bill Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky affair the Republican House voted 221 to 212 that he should be, but the majority wasn’t there in the Senate. His poll ratings climbed.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On November 6, midterm elections for the House and Senate could lead to a Democrat majority in the first and almost a tie in the second. In that case the Democrats might feel emboldened to begin impeachment proceedings. Many will want them to, but should they?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">If the Michael Cohen Truth Fund or anyone else can provide proof that Donald Trump knew and approved of Russian government attempts to sabotage the Clinton campaign, then Congress — Democrat or Republican — has no choice, morally or constitutionally but to impeach. But in the absence of that proof, and despite the seriousness of Cohen’s allegations against the president concerning hush payments to women during the election campaign, the Democrats should think better of it.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s not just because if they do get rid of Trump they effectively elect the culture warrior Mike Pence. It’s because for the period of the proceedings they will inevitably be substituting process for politics. Should Trump survive the attempt he might, like a malign Obi Wan Kenobi — and Bill Clinton — emerge even stronger, and the Democrats will have wasted several critical months when they should have been arguing about how America could be better.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s true that anti-Trump feeling energises the Democrat base, and quite a few other people as well. But a successful 2020 presidential bid, which after all begins pretty soon, requires so much more. The Democrats have to be the party of growth, fair taxes, decent health provision, infrastructural improvement, of the working person as well as of the entrepreneur. They have to tackle gerrymandering, bent campaign finance and the antiquated and vulnerable US electoral system. And in Bill Clinton’s words, they must never stop arguing. But as Americans might put it, impeachment is an O2-suck. It detracts from the task.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Over here we can only look on. The United States is indispensable for us, but alas we matter only a bit to a Bostonian, a little less to a San Diegan and not at all to a Utahn. And since we’re not Russians we have no say in US elections. We have seen America at its best and can only hope that the best returns.</p></div>",false

"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p class=""dropcap@1"">Just before Christmas 2015, Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen took to Twitter to address his client’s likely opponent Hillary Clinton directly. “When you go to prison for defrauding America and perjury,” he told her, “your room and board will be free!”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Hillary of course has never been charged with anything and as of Tuesday Michael Cohen is looking at going to prison after pleading guilty to bank fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance fraud. This last crime was, he says, carried out at the direct behest of Mr Trump. Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis said yesterday that his client had “decided on July 2nd to press the reset button” and there would now be established a Michael Cohen Truth Fund.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Reset buttons are a good idea. We should press ours. So let’s imagine that 20 odd years ago Rippa Van Winkle, an upright, fair-minded, un-ideological American citizen, fell asleep and only woke up a year ago. After marvelling at the development of the internet and the fact that no one uses phones as phones any more, she begins to look at who is ruling America. She is interested only in facts. What would someone like that make of Donald Trump being her president?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">She would almost certainly note that, for whatever reason, he is a constant and unashamed liar. The record shows also that he is a serial adulterer who has boasted on tape about sexually harassing women. If she dips into the more reliable biographies of him she will discover that he seems to be a bit of a racist. Rippa will have seen his propensity for harshly criticising America’s oldest allies and warmly commending various authoritarian leaders abroad. She’ll have watched the unprecedented merry-go-round of incoming and sacked cabinet members.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">And in the last few months there have been all those close associates in trouble with the law. Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador; Rick Gates to conspiracy and lying to the FBI; and on Tuesday the former campaign manager and Trump hearty Paul Manafort, found guilty on eight counts of tax and bank fraud and of hiding a foreign bank account — and most of it in the service of some ultra-dodgy oligarch-types.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa takes account of the suggestion that, never mind the quality, feel the width. Hasn’t Mr Trump presided over an unprecedented economic recovery, and have his unorthodox foreign policies not yielded unexpected dividends? She looks at the figures and the results, compares them with past presidents and concludes, coolly, that there is no real evidence for either claim. She may even recall that when she first went to sleep Republicans were in favour of free trade and against deficits and now they appear to prefer trade wars and unfunded tax cuts.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On Tuesday Rippa watched, as we did, when Lanny Davis hinted at more Cohen truth-telling to come. And this time on a matter which touches on the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election (which she fortunately missed) and possible collusion with the Russians by the Trump campaign.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">“Rippa,” we ask her, “none of us can be sure of this at the moment. But if you had to guess whether Donald Trump knew that the Russians were offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016, what would you say?” And Rippa, beyond a flicker of a doubt would say, “Of course he did, are you kidding me? This is Donald Trump we’re talking about.”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">When in June 2016, after an exchange of emails, Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, in the expectation that she had from somewhere procured “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, it is a stretch to believe that Trump Senior did not know. And Rippa wonders whether even if Veselnitskaya had had “FSB” tattooed on her knuckles, the Trumps would have seen anything wrong in mining her for useful stuff.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa is tired now, and we’ll let her go. We’ve told her that Trump can’t be criminally indicted for the campaign finance fraud, because he’s the president. He could possibly be impeached for it, because impeachment is in the first instance a political act. The House of Representatives has to vote for impeachment by a simple majority, but for it to be successful the Senate then has to try the case and find against the incumbent by a two thirds majority. Nixon wasn’t impeached: he resigned before he could be. With Bill Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky affair the Republican House voted 221 to 212 that he should be, but the majority wasn’t there in the Senate. His poll ratings climbed.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On November 6, midterm elections for the House and Senate could lead to a Democrat majority in the first and almost a tie in the second. In that case the Democrats might feel emboldened to begin impeachment proceedings. Many will want them to, but should they?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">If the Michael Cohen Truth Fund or anyone else can provide proof that Donald Trump knew and approved of Russian government attempts to sabotage the Clinton campaign, then Congress — Democrat or Republican — has no choice, morally or constitutionally but to impeach. But in the absence of that proof, and despite the seriousness of Cohen’s allegations against the president concerning hush payments to women during the election campaign, the Democrats should think better of it.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s not just because if they do get rid of Trump they effectively elect the culture warrior Mike Pence. It’s because for the period of the proceedings they will inevitably be substituting process for politics. Should Trump survive the attempt he might, like a malign Obi Wan Kenobi — and Bill Clinton — emerge even stronger, and the Democrats will have wasted several critical months when they should have been arguing about how America could be better.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s true that anti-Trump feeling energises the Democrat base, and quite a few other people as well. But a successful 2020 presidential bid, which after all begins pretty soon, requires so much more. The Democrats have to be the party of growth, fair taxes, decent health provision, infrastructural improvement, of the working person as well as of the entrepreneur. They have to tackle gerrymandering, bent campaign finance and the antiquated and vulnerable US electoral system. And in Bill Clinton’s words, they must never stop arguing. But as Americans might put it, impeachment is an O2-suck. It detracts from the task.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Over here we can only look on. The United States is indispensable for us, but alas we matter only a bit to a Bostonian, a little less to a San Diegan and not at all to a Utahn.

"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p class=""dropcap@1"">Just before Christmas 2015, Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen took to Twitter to address his client’s likely opponent Hillary Clinton directly. “When you go to prison for defrauding America and perjury,” he told her, “your room and board will be free!”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Hillary of course has never been charged with anything and as of Tuesday Michael Cohen is looking at going to prison after pleading guilty to bank fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance fraud. This last crime was, he says, carried out at the direct behest of Mr Trump. Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis said yesterday that his client had “decided on July 2nd to press the reset button” and there would now be established a Michael Cohen Truth Fund.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Reset buttons are a good idea. We should press ours. So let’s imagine that 20 odd years ago Rippa Van Winkle, an upright, fair-minded, un-ideological American citizen, fell asleep and only woke up a year ago. After marvelling at the development of the internet and the fact that no one uses phones as phones any more, she begins to look at who is ruling America. She is interested only in facts. What would someone like that make of Donald Trump being her president?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">She would almost certainly note that, for whatever reason, he is a constant and unashamed liar. The record shows also that he is a serial adulterer who has boasted on tape about sexually harassing women. If she dips into the more reliable biographies of him she will discover that he seems to be a bit of a racist. Rippa will have seen his propensity for harshly criticising America’s oldest allies and warmly commending various authoritarian leaders abroad. She’ll have watched the unprecedented merry-go-round of incoming and sacked cabinet members.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">And in the last few months there have been all those close associates in trouble with the law. Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador; Rick Gates to conspiracy and lying to the FBI; and on Tuesday the former campaign manager and Trump hearty Paul Manafort, found guilty on eight counts of tax and bank fraud and of hiding a foreign bank account — and most of it in the service of some ultra-dodgy oligarch-types.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa takes account of the suggestion that, never mind the quality, feel the width. Hasn’t Mr Trump presided over an unprecedented economic recovery, and have his unorthodox foreign policies not yielded unexpected dividends? She looks at the figures and the results, compares them with past presidents and concludes, coolly, that there is no real evidence for either claim. She may even recall that when she first went to sleep Republicans were in favour of free trade and against deficits and now they appear to prefer trade wars and unfunded tax cuts.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On Tuesday Rippa watched, as we did, when Lanny Davis hinted at more Cohen truth-telling to come. And this time on a matter which touches on the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election (which she fortunately missed) and possible collusion with the Russians by the Trump campaign.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">“Rippa,” we ask her, “none of us can be sure of this at the moment. But if you had to guess whether Donald Trump knew that the Russians were offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016, what would you say?” And Rippa, beyond a flicker of a doubt would say, “Of course he did, are you kidding me? This is Donald Trump we’re talking about.”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">When in June 2016, after an exchange of emails, Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, in the expectation that she had from somewhere procured “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, it is a stretch to believe that Trump Senior did not know. And Rippa wonders whether even if Veselnitskaya had had “FSB” tattooed on her knuckles, the Trumps would have seen anything wrong in mining her for useful stuff.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa is tired now, and we’ll let her go. We’ve told her that Trump can’t be criminally indicted for the campaign finance fraud, because he’s the president. He could possibly be impeached for it, because impeachment is in the first instance a political act. The House of Representatives has to vote for impeachment by a simple majority, but for it to be successful the Senate then has to try the case and find against the incumbent by a two thirds majority. Nixon wasn’t impeached: he resigned before he could be. With Bill Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky affair the Republican House voted 221 to 212 that he should be, but the majority wasn’t there in the Senate. His poll ratings climbed.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On November 6, midterm elections for the House and Senate could lead to a Democrat majority in the first and almost a tie in the second. In that case the Democrats might feel emboldened to begin impeachment proceedings. Many will want them to, but should they?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">If the Michael Cohen Truth Fund or anyone else can provide proof that Donald Trump knew and approved of Russian government attempts to sabotage the Clinton campaign, then Congress — Democrat or Republican — has no choice, morally or constitutionally but to impeach. But in the absence of that proof, and despite the seriousness of Cohen’s allegations against the president concerning hush payments to women during the election campaign, the Democrats should think better of it.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">It’s not just because if they do get rid of Trump they effectively elect the culture warrior Mike Pence.

"<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p class=""dropcap@1"">Just before Christmas 2015, Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen took to Twitter to address his client’s likely opponent Hillary Clinton directly. “When you go to prison for defrauding America and perjury,” he told her, “your room and board will be free!”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Hillary of course has never been charged with anything and as of Tuesday Michael Cohen is looking at going to prison after pleading guilty to bank fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance fraud. This last crime was, he says, carried out at the direct behest of Mr Trump. Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis said yesterday that his client had “decided on July 2nd to press the reset button” and there would now be established a Michael Cohen Truth Fund.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Reset buttons are a good idea. We should press ours. So let’s imagine that 20 odd years ago Rippa Van Winkle, an upright, fair-minded, un-ideological American citizen, fell asleep and only woke up a year ago. After marvelling at the development of the internet and the fact that no one uses phones as phones any more, she begins to look at who is ruling America. She is interested only in facts. What would someone like that make of Donald Trump being her president?</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">She would almost certainly note that, for whatever reason, he is a constant and unashamed liar. The record shows also that he is a serial adulterer who has boasted on tape about sexually harassing women. If she dips into the more reliable biographies of him she will discover that he seems to be a bit of a racist. Rippa will have seen his propensity for harshly criticising America’s oldest allies and warmly commending various authoritarian leaders abroad. She’ll have watched the unprecedented merry-go-round of incoming and sacked cabinet members.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">And in the last few months there have been all those close associates in trouble with the law. Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador; Rick Gates to conspiracy and lying to the FBI; and on Tuesday the former campaign manager and Trump hearty Paul Manafort, found guilty on eight counts of tax and bank fraud and of hiding a foreign bank account — and most of it in the service of some ultra-dodgy oligarch-types.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa takes account of the suggestion that, never mind the quality, feel the width. Hasn’t Mr Trump presided over an unprecedented economic recovery, and have his unorthodox foreign policies not yielded unexpected dividends? She looks at the figures and the results, compares them with past presidents and concludes, coolly, that there is no real evidence for either claim. She may even recall that when she first went to sleep Republicans were in favour of free trade and against deficits and now they appear to prefer trade wars and unfunded tax cuts.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">On Tuesday Rippa watched, as we did, when Lanny Davis hinted at more Cohen truth-telling to come. And this time on a matter which touches on the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election (which she fortunately missed) and possible collusion with the Russians by the Trump campaign.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">“Rippa,” we ask her, “none of us can be sure of this at the moment. But if you had to guess whether Donald Trump knew that the Russians were offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016, what would you say?” And Rippa, beyond a flicker of a doubt would say, “Of course he did, are you kidding me? This is Donald Trump we’re talking about.”</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">When in June 2016, after an exchange of emails, Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, in the expectation that she had from somewhere procured “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, it is a stretch to believe that Trump Senior did not know. And Rippa wonders whether even if Veselnitskaya had had “FSB” tattooed on her knuckles, the Trumps would have seen anything wrong in mining her for useful stuff.</p><p class=""dropcap@1"">Rippa is tired now, and we’ll let her go. We’ve told her that Trump can’t be criminally indicted for the campaign finance fraud, because he’s the president. He could possibly be impeached for it, because impeachment is in the first instance a political act.
